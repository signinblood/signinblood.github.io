Hello!

We're Sign in Blood, a mysterious organization dedicated to creating a [secret], awesome new Thing.

While I can't say much right now, I'm excited to see you here, and can't wait to tell you more.

Really, it's killing me having to stay this quiet.
I want to write so much more about this idea, I promise.

## So, when will we share more?

It's likely that's your next question. After all, there's nothing here. It's empty.

There's not even a scent of a trail leading to what Sign in Blood could be.
In fact, that's intentional, but I'm not too happy about it either.

I'm hoping to have more substantial information to share in 2024.
There may be further blog posts from here, but that also depends on how everything goes. \

Being totally transparent, this project will become one of two Things.
In one case, we're going to create a physical Thing.
In another case, this will be a software Thing.

Both outcomes hinge on secretive business dealings and all sorts of other legal requirements.
It's not that I don't want to tell you more, it's that I basically can't right now.
